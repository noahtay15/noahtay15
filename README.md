<h2>Software Development Projects:</h2>

   <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/Word-Guesser">Word Guesser</a>
        <p>A 1-4 player Jeopardy-style game showcasing my recently obtained skills in .NET. This project faithfully replicates the Jeopardy format, featuring 5 categories, each with 4 randomly selected questions, adding an element of limited replayability. Additionally, players have the flexibility to personalize their gaming experience by inputting custom names and theme colors.</p>

       <li>
          <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/Jokes-Database">Jokes Database Web App</a>
          <p>Crash course ASP.NET Web App I did summer 2023.</p>

    </ul>

   <h3>Senior Capstone Project</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <a href="https://github.com/noahtay15/Transportation-Flow-Analysis">Transportation Flow Analysis</a>
         <p>Work in progress fall 2023.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
  <h3>Software Engineering Final</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/peer8-Peer_Review_Web_Application">Peer8 Peer Review Web Application System</a>
      <p>This was the final project of my Software Engineering class. We were tasked to make a peer review system that allowed student and instructor accounts. This project was meant as a simulation of Scrum Agile development methodology. We only completed one sprint, so the entire project isn't fully complete, but there is a lot done, plus a whole lot of documentation. In this repository there is both the documentation for sprint 1, and some documentation for what sprint 2 would look like, if we were to actually continue the development. In case you don't want to go through the hassle of trying to set up local hosting to view what it looks like, there are some screenshots of the pages in the User's Guide section of the project document file.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Java</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/DnDCharacterCreator">DnD Character Creator</a>
        <p> This is a text-based program entirely in Java. It was the final project of my freshman Data Structures and Program Design class. I have not gone back to refactor this code as of yet since freshman year, but I intend to completely redo this eventually.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
  <h3>Python</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/Python-Coursework-CPSC2100">Python Coursework CPSC 2100</a>
        <p>This is just the midterm and final python programming questions I had for my sophomore Software Design and Development class. Also added a few other small assignments.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
  <h3>Basic Website, File, and Database Processing</h3>
  <p>These repositories are mainly going to contain things from my File and Database Processing class. In that class I used MySQL, basic HTML to interact with the database, and PHP. I did not learn CSS in order to make the html files more "pretty," but since then I have taught myself basic CSS, and intend to continue doing so at some point in the future.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/sha_lookupDB">Sha Value Password Lookup</a>
        <p>Final project of my File and Database Processing class. Contains a locally hosted html that asks you to input the sha value of common passwords. The program will query the database that it makes and gives you the password from it, if it is stored in the database.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/Film_Management_Database">Film Management Database Project</a>
        <p>Another course assignment from my File and Database Processing Class. Used HTML, PHP, and MySQL queries to add new films to the database and pull up a table with all the customers, with a list of things like their addresses and films they have rented in the past.</p>
    </ul>
