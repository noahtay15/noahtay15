  <h3>Basic Website, File, and Database Processing</h3>
  <p>These repositories are mainly going to contain things from my File and Database Processing class. In that class I used MySQL, basic HTML to interact with the database, and PHP. I did not learn CSS in order to make the html files more "pretty," but since then I have taught myself basic CSS, and intend to continue doing so at some point in the future.</p>
