<h2> Software Development Projects:</h2>
  
  <h3>Java</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/DnDCharacterCreator">DnD Character Creator</a>
        <p> This is a text-based program entirely in Java. It was the final project of my freshman Data Structures and Program Design class. I have not gone back to refactor this code as of yet since freshman year, but I intend to completely redo this eventually.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <a href = "">Placeholder Invalid Link</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Python</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "">Placeholder Invalid Link</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Basic Website, File, and Database Processing</h3>
  <p>These repositories are mainly going to contain things from my File and Database Processing class. In that class I used MySQL, basic HTML to interact with the database, and PHP. I did not learn CSS in order to make the html files more "pretty", but since then I have taught myself basic CSS, and intend to continue doing so at some point in the future.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/noahtay15/sha_lookupDB">Sha Value Password Lookup</a>
        <p> Final project of my File and Database Processing class. Contains a locally hosted html that asks you to input the sha value of common passwords. The program will query the database that it makes and gives you the password from it, if it is stored in the database.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
